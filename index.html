<h2>
    Breakfast Cereals
</h2>
<p>
    The best Breakfast Cereal is one that not only fuels you up, but energizes you for the rest of the day. Too much sugar in this cereal can fuel your body with empty carbs and has the chance of slowing you down. Classic cereals that fit the breakfast cereal category are Cheerios, Honey Bunches, and Wheeties. While these classics are okay, there are a select few Cereals that hold the top spot for breakfast treats. Honorable mentions for best breakfast cereal are Frpsted Mini Wheats, HoneyComb and Frosted Flakes. The Best Breakfast Cereal is Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Cinnamon Toast Crunch, otherwise known as "CTC" has the perfect balance of not to sweet, yet extremly delicious. CTC is far and away the number one choice of cereal to most breakfast cereal enjoyers.

<h2>
    Dessert Cereals
</h2>
<p>
    Dessert Cereals are much different compared to breakfast cereal. Dessert cereals don't have to adhere to the rules of breakfast cereals, so the best cereal can be the cereal that just tastes the best. Honorable mentions for the best Dessert Cereals are Fruity Pebbles, Cocoa Krispies, and Reeses Puffys. The Best Dessert Cereal is far and away Crunch Berries. This Cereal is all that is good with Sugary Cereals. It is one of the only combination cereals that has both cereal pieces tasting good. As well, this cereal also goes well with other dessert foods, such as fruit or ice cream.

<h2>
    Underated Cereals
</h2>
<p>
    There are some heavily underated cereals on the market for various reasons. The first Underated cereal are Post's halloween cereals. Count Chocula, Boo Berry and Franken Berry are some of the best cereals of all time, yet only being sold in october keeps it from being one of the most popular cereals. Another extremly underated cereal is French Toast Crunch. I would rate this cereal in the top 5 of all time, but not many people have even tried it before. Being in the shadow of its much more popular older brother, CTC, it is very uncommon to be found in the homes of many americans. Finally, in my opinion the most underated cereal are the dunkin donuts cereals. They have very unique flavors that are don't sound the best in cereal for to many, but trying this cereal has changed my opinion on cereal durasticly.
